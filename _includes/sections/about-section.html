                        <h2>Ghana Natural Language Processing</h2>
                        <p>Recently, there has been a realization that language technologies have been leaving certain languages behind - including most African languages. While Google Translate offers translation services in several African languages,
                            no Ghanaian languages are included, and even for the included languages the quality has been generally found to be quite poor.
                            Major challenges boil down to lack of good (indeed often any) training data, as well as lack of adoption of major language technologies for local problems.</p>
                       <p>Ghana NLP is an Open Source Initiative focused on Natural Language Processing (NLP) of Ghanaian Languages, & its Applications to Local Problems. 
                           While we will begin work on Ghanaian languages initially, likely focusing on Twi due to number of speakers,
                            our ultimate goal is for our tools to be applicable throughout the West African subregion and beyond.</p>
