<p>Khaya was the first translation app for Ghanaian languages relying on Machine Learning/Artificial Intelligence. Since version 1.0.2, it has started expanding to other African languages, such as Yoruba.</p>

It also now includes Automatic Speech Recognition capabilities for Twi and Yoruba - speak directly to your phone and the app will transcribe your speech to text! For these languages, to the best of our knowledge, it is the first and only app to date offering such general speech recognition capabilities!</p>

If you find the app useful and would like to see it grow and improve, kindly purchase an ad-free subscription to support our research. Thank you for your support!</p>

The underlying algorithms are various neural network architectures, built by Algorine Research on top of open source technology developed by Ghana NLP.</p>
