# GhanaNLP Website


**About GhanaNLP:** Ghana NLP is an Open Source Initiative focused on Natural Language Processing (NLP) of Ghanaian Languages, & its Applications to Local Problems. While we will begin work on Ghanaian languages initially, likely focusing on Twi due to number of speakers, our ultimate goal is for our tools to be applicable throughout the West African subregion and beyond. [Website](https://ghananlp.org/)

**What we have done:** Here's a list of projects developed by GhanaNLP. Our project are accessible on a wide range of platforms and you are welcome to check them out. 



- **Khaya Translator Web App:** Khaya was the first translation app for Ghanaian languages relying on Machine Learning/Artificial Intelligence. Since version 1.0.2, it has started expanding to other African languages, such as Yoruba.

It also now includes Automatic Speech Recognition capabilities for Twi and Yoruba - speak directly to your phone and the app will transcribe your speech to text! For these languages, to the best of our knowledge, it is the first and only app to date offering such general speech recognition capabilities!.

- **Abena:** enables a computer to begin to reason in Twi computationally.
